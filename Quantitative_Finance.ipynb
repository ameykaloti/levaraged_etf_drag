    "Levaraged ETFs like TQQQ, are popular with investors because they provide levarage. A $3 \\times$ long ETF like TQQQ, provides $3$ times the daily return compared to the underlying QQQ. Similarly an inverse $3 \\times$ ETF like SQQQ provides $-3$ times the daily return of the underlying QQQ. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most investors it is not recommended to buy and hold these ETFs over the long term. The reason given is that they suffer a drag and some investors argue that there is a structural problem with these ETFs. Reasons for the drag are generally attributed to the variance and the rebalance drag. The rebalance drag occurs due to the need for rebalancing the derivatives used in structuring of these ETFs. I will explain in this post that levaraged ETFs on indices such as S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq-100 (NDX), do not suffer from rebalance drag. The only source of drag is the variance drag. \n",

As we will see even though data available for these ETFs may suggest that they are safe for longer term holding, the extrapolation of the data will show the problems with this argument."
